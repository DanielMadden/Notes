# 3 Principles of Redux

1. Single source of truth
   - State is stored in the store
   - The store is an object tree
2. State is Ready Only
   - Immutable
   - Dispatch actions describing state change
3. Changes are Made with Pure Functions
   - Pure Functions must:
     - Return value is only dependent on input values
     - No side effects
