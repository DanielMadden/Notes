## Crawlers

- Google Hacking Database
  - Sometimes used, but honestly not often.
  - A better alternative would be site crawlers
- Every site has a `robots.txt`
  - Lists the paths that are disallowed.
  - These pages would typically interest a hacker with malicious intent because they most likely have sensitive information
- pentest-tools.com/information-gathering/google-hacking#
  - Can search for specific vulnerabilities
    - publicly exposed documents
    - directory listing vulnerabilities
    - log files exposed
    - backup and old files
    - etc...
- Fingerprinting
  - Figure out everything you can about the tech stack and framework of the application
- DevTools
  - Use the devtools before utilizing burpsuite to get used to seeing exactly what it's doing. Otherwise you'd probably become reliant on burpsuite
- Time Management
  - Trevor
    - Half hour each morning dedicated to the portswigger
  - Siddarth
    - Month ish to read I didn't really hear him
  - Anil
    - 2 Months to read
  - Aakash Rathee
    - 2 Months to ge tthrough the PortSwigger labs
- Theory + Practice
  - Both are equally important
  - Labs are kind of like a simulator
  - The real world is not like the labs
  - If you don't stick to the theory, you won't know the trade secrets
  - Both need to be balanced
- These resources are important
  - These are things the india team actually used to learn
