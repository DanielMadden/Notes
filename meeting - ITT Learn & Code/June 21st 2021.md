1. Why is it important to think beyond the “happy path”?

   - Not too sure what "happy path" means in code. I'll assume it's like the most optimal piece of code that gives us what we want?
   - But errors can always happen
   - We need to always be prepared for the "not so happy path"
   - "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong" - Murphy's Law

2. How might chapters 2,3,6 and 10 influence error handling strategy
   - Chapter 3
     - Small! Functions need to be kept small. This ties into why try catch statements are important, since they can shorten our code as opposed to being prepared to handle error codes.
   - Chapter 10
     - Single Responsibility. Like when we needed to define exception classes in terms of a caller's needs
